# Transfer Learning with Pre-trained DenseNet121

This repository contains a Google Colab implementation of **transfer learning** using a **pre-trained DenseNet121** model on the **UEH-VDR (Vietnamese Dish Recognition)** dataset.  
It demonstrates how to efficiently adapt a high-performance model for new image classification tasks.
